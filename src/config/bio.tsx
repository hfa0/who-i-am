    <p>Hi visitors, </p>
    I'm happy you get lost in this jungle of connected networks and finally landed on my page. My name is Husein. I'm{" "}
    {myAge()} years old and I'm a Software Developer.
    <p>
      I love to write code, learn new things and read good books. My favorite one is War and Pease. I love the way
      Tolstoy describes situations and peoples personalities. It's like I have pictures of every single character he
      mentioned in this book - Just joking. There are so many I couldn't even count them.
    </p>

      My greatest idol is Ignatiy Stelletsky. I do really respect people who fight for what makes them happy, even that
      happiness was finding the truth and he didn't succeed (sorry bro, I can really feel you. These books in that
      mysteriously lost library from one of the most terrible guys ever lived must be f**ing awesome).
    </p>
    <p>
      My favorite movies are <strong>Interstellar</strong> and <strong>No Country for Old Men</strong>. I'm very
      fascinated about the universe, maths and physics. And of course, I love computers - how one couldn't? Still, I'm
      kind of an old-fashioned person. I love greek philosophy and the way antic civilizations viewed the world. From
      the Mayan to the Babylonian, Egyptian, Hindu and Roman - What we learned in the past will help us improve in the
      future.
    </p>
    <p>
      When I'm not writing code, I like to explore the world. I like to go to places few people have been. I love
      beaches, lakes and every place where there is water. I love plants and it makes me happy watching them growing and
      blooming.
